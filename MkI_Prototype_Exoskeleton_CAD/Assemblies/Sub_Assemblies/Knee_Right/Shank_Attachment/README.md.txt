## SR101 – Shank Attachment Subassembly

Purpose:
Provides structural attachment and alignment for carbon fiber shank tubes within the Knee Right assembly.


Fabrication: 

The shank attachment subassembly is designed for a combination of additive manufacturing and off-the-shelf components.

**Custom Parts:**
- The shank clamp and TPU insert are intended to be 3D printed.
- Clamp components are printed in a rigid material (e.g., PLA, PETG, or Nylon) for structural support.
- The TPU insert is printed in flexible TPU to improve grip and reduce stress concentrations on the carbon fiber tubes.

**Standard Components:**
- Carbon fiber tubes and fasteners are off-the-shelf components and require no fabrication (MCMASTER CARR - 5287T627) .
- Fasteners are selected to allow easy assembly and disassembly during prototyping (MCMASTER CARR - 95836A244).
- Heated inserts are used within the 3D printed pieces for smooth insertion of the fasteners.
- Epoxy is used to hold pieces together

**Assembly Process:**
1. 3D print clamp components and TPU insert.
2. Insert TPU component into the clamp interface and secure using epoxy.
3. Secure clamping mechanism to aluminum extrusion using epoxy. 
4. Place carbon fiber tubes into the clamp.
5. Secure assembly using standard fasteners to achieve clamping force.

This approach allows rapid iteration and easy replacement of components during early prototyping.
